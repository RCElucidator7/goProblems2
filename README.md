Second set of Go Problems 

Curl

curl -i localhost:8080
The user enters this command in the command prompt (cmder), assuming the user has the nessessary files in the bin folder (Files curl.exe, curllib and curl-ca-bundle) which can be found on the curl website. Before this though the user much run the .go file by either converting it to an executionable file (.exe) or by typing "go run (File name)" in the command prompt in the directory where the file is. Once the curl command is executed then the console, the user should be able to view the contents by typing "http://localhost:8080" into the URL bar.
